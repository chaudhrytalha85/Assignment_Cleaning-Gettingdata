# Description of Output
The output is a txt file of the tidy data, created from the Samasung Data sets. Its a wide format tidy data, with each row a combination of Subject ID and Activity performed, while the cloumns are the values of the variables that correspond to that combination.

## Subject ID
There are thirty subjects, between the ages of 19-48, who volunteered. They were given ID numbers from 1 to 30.

## Activity
There were 6 types of activities the subjects were asked to perform for the experiment while wearing a Smartphone (Samsung Galaxy SII). The six activities were: WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

## Data Features
Using the smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial (XYZ) linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were recorded. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% for the test data. For a detailed description of what variables were recorded, please see "features_info.txt". The numeric variables that I have included are the mean and standard deviation (std) variables. Then I have **averaged** them for a particular subject performing a particular activity. The following variables have been included with my decriptive names in the parantheses for somw of them, that i used to rename them for a better description, eacpet for mean/std and axis. For names of all variables please see "features.txt.
